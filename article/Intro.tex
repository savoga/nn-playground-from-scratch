\section{Intro}

Neural networks became increasingly popular in the last few years as showed by the research topics of the recent years (https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/05/winning-machine-learning-competition.html). The main advantage of those models is that they can learn complex structure and are highly customizable. However, one significant drawback is their poor explanability power. Neural networks are often categorized in the so-called "black box models".
Fortunately, there are some very good tutorials on learning how a neural network actually works. Today, every data scientist know the tutorials of Andrew Ng (https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). \\

After having done those tutorials, I personally found out that a 1-layer network is relatively easy to understand, however it gets tricky when increasing the number of layers. This article is an attempt to understand in details the 2-layer neural network through the building of a small playground. We will even publish the playground online! To enjoy fully this article, the reader must be aware of the working of a 1-layer neural network.\\

As a reminder, a 1-layer network looks like this: \\

Note that the input layer is usually ignored when counting the layers.

I won't give much more details here, I strongly recommend Andrew Ng's tutorial for more details or this article (https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-neural-networks-and-backpropagation-machine-learning-made-easy-e5285bc2be3a) for a wrap up.

A 2-layer network looks like this: \\

Let's now go into deeper details on the working on such an algorithm.
