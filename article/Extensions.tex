\section{Extensions}

The extension possibilities are endless! You can think about adding checkboxes/buttons so that the user can: \\

- the noise (standard deviation) associated with the data generation

- the number of data points to be generated

- the learning rate to be used during the parameter update

- the number of layers \\

For the last point however, I believe it would require significantly more work, especially if you don't use any neural network library (like tensorflow or pytorch) as we do here. \\

Have fun!
