\section{Key insights}

When playing with the app we can already draw some interesting insights:

- 1 hidden unit gives a linear separation that is especially visible when selecting circles. \\

- 2 hidden units give a better separation \\

IMAGE \\

- 3 hidden units give a perfect separation of the clusters when choosing moons.

This illustrates the power of neural networks :) You can think of how good they can be when identifying human faces or finger prints!
