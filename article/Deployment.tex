\section{Deployment}

The deployment is done via \href{https://www.heroku.com/}{Heroku}. The clear steps for deployment are explained \href{https://dash.plotly.com/deployment}{here}. As mentioned in the link, "Heroku is one of the easiest platforms for deploying and managing public Flask applications.".

To sum up, the deployment consists in hosting the code in a Github repo, then deploying through Heroku with this command:

\lstset{language=bash}
\lstset{frame=lines}
\lstset{caption={Deploy the app}}
\lstset{label={lst:code_direct}}
\lstset{basicstyle=\footnotesize}
\begin{lstlisting}

$ git push heroku master

\end{lstlisting}
